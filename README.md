Test Beam Amplifier Board


We plan on using the TBAmp board at the test beam on July 22-August 19 as a method of 
reading out several individual SiPM channels and passing the rest of the signals through
the board on the PADE card. 


This branch has the non-mirrored version and the mirrored version of the Amplifier board on
a single board layout for manufacturing.
