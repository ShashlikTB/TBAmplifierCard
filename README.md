Test Beam Amplifier Board


We plan on using the TBAmp board at the test beam on July 22-August 19 as a method of 
reading out several individual SiPM channels and passing the rest of the signals through
the board on the PADE card. 


This branch has the non-mirrored version of the Amplifier board with a longer and
less wide layout than the version we actually got manufactured. 
The reason for the difference in width came from the necessity of matching
the width of the amplifier card and the PADE board. This required rerouting the wires and changing the connectors around. 
Similar to the other non-mirrored card, Channels 0,2,4, and 6 got routed to the amplifiers.
