Test Beam Amplifier Board


We plan on using the TBAmp board at the test beam on July 22-August 19 as a method of 
reading out several individual SiPM channels and passing the rest of the signals through
the board on the PADE card. 


This branch has the non-mirrored version of the Amplifier board that pulls 
channels 0,2,4, and 6. The other branches contain other versions of the card and 
have a similar description, this branch got merged into the master branch.
