Test Beam Amplifier Board


We plan on using the TBAmp board at the test beam on July 22-August 19 as a method of 
reading out several individual SiPM channels and passing the rest of the signals through
the board on the PADE card. 


This branch has the mirrored version of the Amplifier board. 

Channels 25, 27, 28, and 30 have been routed to the amplifiers on this version of the board.
